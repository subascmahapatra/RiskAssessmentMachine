# RiskAssessmentMachine
The risk will be measured by the formula
      Risk = Likelihood * Impact

Impact is the magnitude of the potential loss. Likelihood is how likely the loss will occur. 

This implementation will use KAFKA, STORM and ESPER to consume message streams and apply the 
formula to assess the risk.
